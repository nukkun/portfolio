This repository is a collection of projects I based on existing ones whether from a tutorial or someone else who made it in a site like github. But it would be boring if I were to show a clone of another project, so I did a little "hacking" on this project to make it worthwhile to be read.

It's also going to contain projects I thought of and will think of, if the idea is not original, I'll go to some lengths to add features that say it's mine.

This repository will contain a lot of folders for you to navigate to, it's like a super respository. It might be different in the future, I dunno, I'm still new to github.

And as you may notice, I'm too lazy to write a proper Readme.MD, I'm not trying to focus on such trivial details, I just want my repository to have content.
